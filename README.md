# Technologies 
The front end is built using React.JS, HTML/CSS, using react hooks and react-scroll for the nav bar.

# Details
* The "useState" and "useEffect" Hooks from React are used to track menu "state" open vs. closed and animating the navbar.
* React-scroll is used for linking anchors to sections within the HTML.
* gh-pages is used to deploy HTML to the github domain. 
* Font-awesome is used for the social media icons.
